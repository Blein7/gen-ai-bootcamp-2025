## Business Requirements
To facilitate widespread adoption and scalability, we plan to extend our language learning platform to educational institutions while maintaining proprietary rights to distribute and develop the application.
## Data Strategy
To support the scalable growth and effectiveness of our language learning platform, we will develop a comprehensive data strategy that prioritizes the usage of our vector database and assures security of user's data.
## Model selection
For the initial phase of our project, we will leverage free-tier, open-source AI applications to facilitate model selection and proof-of-concept development. Once we have refined our approach and validated our models, we will transition to utilizing the Effect AI platform to train and deploy our models at scale, taking advantage of its robust infrastructure and advanced AI capabilities.
## Infrastructure Design
For our infrastructure design, we will leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our preferred cloud platform, given its pioneering role in cloud development and widespread global adoption. We will harness AWS's robust capabilities to seamlessly run our GenAI applications, ensuring highly available and scalable services that meet the demands of our users.
